[+] The form element [+]
- Form Element: a container element like the div element, which wraps all of the inputs a user will interact with
    - accepts 2 essential attributes:
        - action (takes a URL that tells the form where it should send its data to be processed)
        - method (tells the browser which HTTP request method it should use to submit the form)
    - The GET and POST request methods are the two you will find yourself using the most.
        - GET: used when we want to retrieve something from a server
            Ex.
                Google uses a GET request when you search as it "gets" the search results.
        - POST: used when we want to change something on the server
            Ex. 
                When a usr makes an account or makes a payment on a website.
    Overall Ex. (The markup for creating a form element looks like this:)
        <form action="example.com/path" method="post">

        </form>
