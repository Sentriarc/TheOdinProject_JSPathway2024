This lesson covers an overview of frameworks, along with the disadvantages of them. The core concept is that you should master your vanilla CSS fundamentals, which will make switching frameworks later down the line much easier than if you were to dive straight into frameworks now (with weak fundamentals).

[+] Preprocessors Overview [+]
- Preprocessors (precompilers): languages that help you write CSS more easily
    - can reduce code repetition and provide all sorts of time-sxsaving and code-saving features
    - are essentially extensions to vanilla CSS that provide some extra functionality
    - when you run the processor, it takes your code and turns it into vanilla CSS that you can import into your project
    - are not really worth learning much about, as most of the important and useful features are already incorporated into CSS. So unless you really need to use a precompiler, don't use it.
    - some of the standard preprocessors in use are:
        - SASS
        - LESS
        - Stylus
